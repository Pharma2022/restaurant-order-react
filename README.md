# Shah's Diner Scrimba FrontEnd Module 5 - Essential Javascript Concepts

Quick start:

```
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
````

This is a quiz application that uses a restful API from https://opentdb.com/api_config.php . There is no API key required.

See [Demo]([https://get-quizzical.netlify.app/](https://shahs-diner.netlify.app/))

## Functionality
- This features a Menu which has items which you can add to the an order
- If you have a main dish and a beer this qualifies you for 

## Libaries that have been used
- React
- Nanoid
- Font Awesome

## Stretch goals
- The original version of this was part of the Module 5 - Essential Javascript Concepts but I coded this with React. If you wish to see the repo for the original project using vanilla JS you can view this [here](https://github.com/Pharma2022/restaurant-order-app). 
- I utilised conditional rendering to only show the minus icon(-) on the menu item if the item was in the order array
- I used nanoid instead of hard coding an id

## Further Stretch Goals/General Improvements
- To refactor the CSS to make maintenance easier
- To wire up my project to firebase rather than iterating over a data.js file
- To add a dark mode using React-switch
- I would like to add backend functionality to actually verify and accept card details to process payments . I believe I can achieve this using Firebase and will need to do this if I ever develop e-commerce applications.
